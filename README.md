=============

This repo contains the slides from the UCL course INGI2145: CLOUD COMPUTING (Fall 2015)

Millions of people around the world use cloud services, and the numbers are growing rapidly.
This poses question: how do we build software systems and components that scale to millions
of users and petabytes of data, and are "always available"?

Today service providers such as Google, Bing, Facebook, etc. run distributed systems that
scale to millions of requests and thousands of machines from multiple geographically
distributed data centers. Increasingly, the major providers (including Amazon, Google,
Microsoft, HP, and IBM) are looking at "hosting" third-party applications in their data
centers - forming so-called "cloud computing" services.

This course focuses on the issues and programming models related to such cloud computing
environments and distributed data processing technologies: data partitioning, storage
schemes, stream processing, and "mostly shared-nothing" parallel algorithms.
